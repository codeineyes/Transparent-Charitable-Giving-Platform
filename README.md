## 🛡️ Smart Contract Example
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CharityProject {
    struct Project {
        address charity;
        uint256 totalBudget;
        uint256 releasedFunds;
        uint8 completedMilestones;
        bool active;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Project) public projects;

    function createProject(
        address _charity, 
        uint256 _totalBudget,
        uint8 _milestoneCount
    ) public returns (uint256 projectId) {
        // Project creation logic
    }

    function releaseFunds(
        uint256 _projectId, 
        uint8 _milestone
    ) public {
        // Milestone-based fund release
    }
}
```
